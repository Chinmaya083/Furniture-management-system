# furniture-management-system
A simple dbms project which demonstrates the backend process of a furniture shop's dbms using MySQL server.
I've just created a fake database for convenience.
All tables are at least in 3NF.
Triggers and check constraints have been implemented.
I've also added sample nested queries and joins.
